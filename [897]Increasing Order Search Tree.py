# Given the root of a binary search tree, rearrange the tree in in-order so 
# that the leftmost node in the tree is now the root of the tree, and every node has 
# no left child and only one right child. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,8,1,null,null,null,7,9]
# Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6,null,7,null,8,null,9]
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: root = [5,1,7]
# Output: [1,null,5,null,7]
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the given tree will be in the range [1, 100]. 
#  0 <= Node.val <= 1000
