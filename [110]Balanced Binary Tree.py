# Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced. 
# 
#  For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as: 
# 
#  
#  a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in 
# height by no more than 1. 
#  
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
# Output: true
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]
# Output: false
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# Input: root = []
# Output: true
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000]. 
#  -10‚Å¥ <= Node.val <= 10‚Å¥
